Responsive is better than fast
It’s not fully shipped until it’s fast
Anything added dilutes everything else
Practicality beats purity
Approachable is better than simple
Mind your words, they are important
Speak like a human
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
Design for failure
Keep it logically awesome
Act as if what you do makes a difference. It does.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.
Never bend your head. Always hold it high. Look the world straight in the eye.
What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.
When you have a dream, you've got to grab it and never let go.
I can't change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.
It is our attitude at the beginning of a difficult task which, more than anything else, will affect its successful outcome.
No matter what you're going through, there's a light at the end of the tunnel.
